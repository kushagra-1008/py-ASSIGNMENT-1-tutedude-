**Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations**
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

MY SOLUTION:
num1 and num2 are variables which take integral inputs from user.
then, i have defined the four arithmetic operations separately as 'add' for addition, 'subtract' for subtraction, 'multiply' for multiplication, 'divide' for division.
At last,  i have define 4 print commands for getting the respective outputs.
